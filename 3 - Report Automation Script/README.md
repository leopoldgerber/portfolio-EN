### - Objective -
Eliminate the need to hire an employee to manually assemble reports on weekends. 

### - Expected result -
A family of scripts for automating reports on closed and open trades, deposits and withdrawals, and hedge fund information for a national bank. A bot for sending reports to everyone assigned.

### - Technical tasks -
- Data collection
- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Report automation

### - NOTE -
The project contains 4 scripts, each of which performs its individual assembly at different reporting times (weekly and monthly). All external queries are written individually according to the tasks of the report. The directory contains 2 shortened queries. Due to commercial confidentiality, the data has been changed and key points have been removed. The reduction does not affect the skills shown.

## Examples of scripts and queries
### Script

The <b>mysql</b> library for connecting to a database. Using the <b>configuration</b> file to further connect all scripts to the same login source and due to the confidentiality of login data. Using an <b>external query</b> for convenient editing.
